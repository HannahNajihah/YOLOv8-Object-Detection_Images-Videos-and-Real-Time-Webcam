# YOLOv8 Object Detection: Images, Videos, and Real-Time Webcam

This project demonstrates real-time and batch object detection using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8), one of the most advanced deep learning models for computer vision tasks.

It covers three practical applications relevant to industry use cases in autonomous systems, video analytics, and smart surveillance:

1. Static Image Detection (from URLs or local images)

2. Video File Detection (batch inference with annotated output video)

3. Webcam Streaming Detection in Google Colab (real-time object detection via browser)

# Features

ðŸ”¹ Pretrained Models: Supports YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m â€” trade-off between speed and accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Image Inference: Detect objects from static images (URLs/local).

ðŸ”¹ Video Inference: Process entire video files, outputting annotated bounding-box videos.

ðŸ”¹ Webcam Streaming in Colab: Real-time detection using a browser-based video stream.

ðŸ”¹ Customizable Confidence Thresholds (conf=0.4 used here).
